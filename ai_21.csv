34258283,"Artificial Intelligence Techniques: Analysis, Application, and Outcome in Dentistry-A Systematic Review.","Ahmed N, Abbasi MS, Zuberi F, Qamar W, Halim MSB, Maqsood A, Alam MK",BioMed research international,2021,10.1155/2021/9751564,"The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the quality and outcome of studies into artificial intelligence techniques, analysis, and effect in dentistry. Using the MeSH keywords: artificial intelligence (AI), dentistry, AI in dentistry, neural networks and dentistry, machine learning, AI dental imaging, and AI treatment recommendations and dentistry. Two investigators performed an electronic search in 5 databases: PubMed/MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), Scopus (Elsevier), ScienceDirect databases (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), and the Cochrane Collaboration (Wiley). The English language articles reporting on AI in different dental specialties were screened for eligibility. Thirty-two full-text articles were selected and systematically analyzed according to a predefined inclusion criterion. These articles were analyzed as per a specific research question, and the relevant data based on article general characteristics, study and control groups, assessment methods, outcomes, and quality assessment were extracted. The initial search identified 175 articles related to AI in dentistry based on the title and abstracts. The full text of 38 articles was assessed for eligibility to exclude studies not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Six articles not related to AI in dentistry were excluded. Thirty-two articles were included in the systematic review. It was revealed that AI provides accurate patient management, dental diagnosis, prediction, and decision making. Artificial intelligence appeared as a reliable modality to enhance future implications in the various fields of dentistry, i.e., diagnostic dentistry, patient management, head and neck cancer, restorative dentistry, prosthetic dental sciences, orthodontics, radiology, and periodontics. The included studies describe that AI is a reliable tool to make dental care smooth, better, time-saving, and economical for practitioners. AI benefits them in fulfilling patient demand and expectations. The dentists can use AI to ensure quality treatment, better oral health care outcome, and achieve precision. AI can help to predict failures in clinical scenarios and depict reliable solutions. However, AI is increasing the scope of state-of-the-art models in dentistry but is still under development. Further studies are required to assess the clinical performance of AI techniques in dentistry.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34258283/
32449232,"The use of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning in oncologic histopathology.","Sultan AS, Elgharib MA, Tavares T, Jessri M, Basile JR",Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,2020 Oct,10.1111/jop.13042,"Recently, there has been a momentous drive to apply advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to diagnostic medicine. The introduction of AI has provided vast new opportunities to improve health care and has introduced a new wave of heightened precision in oncologic pathology. The impact of AI on oncologic pathology has now become apparent, and its use with respect to oral oncology is still in the nascent stage. A foundational overview of AI classification systems used in medicine and a review of common terminology used in machine learning and computational pathology will be presented. This paper provides a focused review on the recent advances in AI and deep learning in oncologic histopathology and oral oncology. In addition, specific emphasis on recent studies that have applied these technologies to oral cancer prognostication will also be discussed. Machine and deep learning methods designed to enhance prognostication of oral cancer have been proposed with much of the work focused on prediction models on patient survival and locoregional recurrences in patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). Few studies have explored machine learning methods on OSCC digital histopathologic images. It is evident that further research at the whole slide image level is needed and future collaborations with computer scientists may progress the field of oral oncology.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32449232/

We aimed to systematically review deep learning studies on caries detection. We selected diagnostic accuracy studies that used deep learning models on dental imagery (including radiographs, photographs, optical coherence tomography images, near-infrared light transillumination images). The latest version of the quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used for risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in the studies methods and their performance measurements. Databases (Medline via PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase) and a repository (ArXiv) were screened for publications published after 2010, without any limitation on language. From 252 potentially eligible references, 48 studies were assessed full-text and 42 included, using classification (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;26), object detection (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;6), or segmentation models (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10). A wide range of performance metrics was used; image, object or pixel accuracy ranged between 68%-99%. The minority of studies (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;11) showed a low risk of biases in all domains, and 13 studies (31.0%) low risk for concerns regarding applicability. The accuracy of caries classification models varied, i.e. 71% to 96% on intra-oral photographs, 82% to 99.2% on peri-apical radiographs, 87.6% to 95.4% on bitewing radiographs, 68.0% to 78.0% on near-infrared transillumination images, 88.7% to 95.2% on optical coherence tomography images, and 86.1% to 96.1% on panoramic radiographs. Pooled diagnostic odds ratios varied from 2.27 to 32,767. For detection and segmentation models, heterogeneity in reporting did not allow useful pooling. An increasing number of studies investigated caries detection using deep learning, with a diverse types of architectures being employed. Reported accuracy seems promising, while study and reporting quality are currently low. Deep learning models can be considered as an assistant for decisions regarding the presence or absence of carious lesions.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35367318/

We aimed to systematically review studies employing DL for periodontal and implantological purposes. A systematic electronic search was conducted on four databases (Medline via PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase) and a repository (ArXiv) for publications after 2010, without any limitation on language. In the present review, we included studies that reported deep learning models' performance on periodontal or oral implantological tasks. Given the heterogeneities in the included studies, no meta-analysis was performed. The risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. We included 47 studies: focusing on imaging data (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;20) and non-imaging data in periodontology (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;12), or dental implantology (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15). The detection of periodontitis and gingivitis or periodontal bone loss, the classification of dental implant systems, or the prediction of treatment outcomes in periodontology and implantology were major use cases. The performance of the models was generally high. However, it varied given the employed methods (which includes various types of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multi-layered perceptron (MLP)), the variety in specific modeling tasks, as well as the chosen and reported outcomes, outcome measures and outcome level. Only a few studies (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;7) showed a low risk of bias across all assessed domains. A growing number of studies evaluated DL for periodontal or implantological objectives. Heterogeneity in study design, poor reporting and a high risk of bias severely limit the comparability of studies and the robustness of the overall evidence.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35856183/
34046742,Deep learning for cephalometric landmark detection: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Schwendicke F, Chaurasia A, Arsiwala L, Lee JH, Elhennawy K, Jost-Brinkmann PG, Demarco F, Krois J",Clinical oral investigations,2021 Jul,10.1007/s00784-021-03990-w,"Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly employed for automated landmark detection, e.g., for cephalometric purposes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the accuracy and underlying evidence for DL for cephalometric landmark detection on 2-D and 3-D radiographs. Diagnostic accuracy studies published in 2015-2020 in Medline/Embase/IEEE/arXiv and employing DL for cephalometric landmark detection were identified and extracted by two independent reviewers. Random-effects meta-analysis, subgroup, and meta-regression were performed, and study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2. The review was registered (PROSPERO no. 227498). From 321 identified records, 19 studies (published 2017-2020), all employing convolutional neural networks, mainly on 2-D lateral radiographs (n=15), using data from publicly available datasets (n=12) and testing the detection of a mean of 30 (SD: 25; range.: 7-93) landmarks, were included. The reference test was established by two experts (n=11), 1 expert (n=4), 3 experts (n=3), and a set of annotators (n=1). Risk of bias was high, and applicability concerns were detected for most studies, mainly regarding the data selection and reference test conduct. Landmark prediction error centered around a 2-mm error threshold (mean; 95% confidence interval: (-0.581; 95 CI: -1.264 to 0.102 mm)). The proportion of landmarks detected within this 2-mm threshold was 0.799 (0.770 to 0.824). DL shows relatively high accuracy for detecting landmarks on cephalometric imagery. The overall body of evidence is consistent but suffers from high risk of bias. Demonstrating robustness and generalizability of DL for landmark detection is needed. Existing DL models show consistent and largely high accuracy for automated detection of cephalometric landmarks. The majority of studies so far focused on 2-D imagery; data on 3-D imagery are sparse, but promising. Future studies should focus on demonstrating generalizability, robustness, and clinical usefulness of DL for this objective.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34046742/
30056118,Detection and diagnosis of dental caries using a deep learning-based convolutional neural network algorithm.,"Lee JH, Kim DH, Jeong SN, Choi SH",Journal of dentistry,2018 Oct,10.1016/j.jdent.2018.07.015,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a rapidly emerging new area of medical research, and have yielded impressive results in diagnosis and prediction in the fields of radiology and pathology. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of deep CNN algorithms for detection and diagnosis of dental caries on periapical radiographs. A total of 3000 periapical radiographic images were divided into a training and validation dataset (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2400 [80%]) and a test dataset (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;600 [20%]). A pre-trained GoogLeNet Inception v3 CNN network was used for preprocessing and transfer learning. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for detection and diagnostic performance of the deep CNN algorithm. The diagnostic accuracies of premolar, molar, and both premolar and molar models were 89.0% (80.4-93.3), 88.0% (79.2-93.1), and 82.0% (75.5-87.1), respectively. The deep CNN algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.917 (95% CI 0.860-0.975) on premolar, an AUC of 0.890 (95% CI 0.819-0.961) on molar, and an AUC of 0.845 (95% CI 0.790-0.901) on both premolar and molar models. The premolar model provided the best AUC, which was significantly greater than those for other models (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). This study highlighted the potential utility of deep CNN architecture for the detection and diagnosis of dental caries. A deep CNN algorithm provided considerably good performance in detecting dental caries in periapical radiographs. CLINICAL SIGNI&#xfb01;CANCE: Deep CNN algorithms are expected to be among the most effective and efficient methods for diagnosing dental caries.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30056118/

Seventy-five CBCT images were included in this study. In these images, bone height and thickness in 508 regions where implants were required were measured by a human observer with manual assessment method using InvivoDental 6.0 (Anatomage Inc. San Jose, CA, USA). Also, canals/sinuses/fossae associated with alveolar bones and missing tooth regions were detected. Following,&#xa0;all&#xa0;evaluations were repeated using the deep convolutional neural network (Diagnocat, Inc., San Francisco, USA) The jaws were separated as mandible/maxilla and each jaw was grouped as anterior/premolar/molar teeth region. The data obtained from manual assessment and AI methods were compared using Bland-Altman analysis and Wilcoxon signed rank test. In the bone height measurements, there were no statistically significant differences between AI and manual measurements in the premolar region of mandible and the premolar and molar regions of the maxilla (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). In the bone thickness measurements, there were statistically significant differences between AI and manual measurements in all regions of maxilla and mandible (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Also, the percentage of right detection was 72.2% for canals, 66.4% for sinuses/fossae and 95.3% for missing tooth regions.

Although various (semi)automated methods have been proposed to segment the jaw or the teeth, there is still a lack of fully automated segmentation methods that can simultaneously segment both anatomic structures in CBCT scans (i.e., multiclass segmentation). In this study, we aimed to train and validate a mixed-scale dense (MS-D) convolutional neural network for multiclass segmentation of the jaw, the teeth, and the background in CBCT scans. Thirty CBCT scans were obtained from patients who had undergone orthodontic treatment. Gold standard segmentation labels were manually created by 4 dentists. As a benchmark, we also evaluated MS-D networks that segmented the jaw or the teeth (i.e., binary segmentation). All segmented CBCT scans were converted to virtual 3-dimensional (3D) models. The segmentation performance of all trained MS-D networks was assessed by the Dice similarity coefficient and surface deviation. The CBCT scans segmented by the MS-D network demonstrated a large overlap with the gold standard segmentations (Dice similarity coefficient: 0.934 &#xb1; 0.019, jaw; 0.945 &#xb1; 0.021, teeth). The MS-D network-based 3D models of the jaw and the teeth showed minor surface deviations when compared with the corresponding gold standard 3D models (0.390 &#xb1; 0.093 mm, jaw; 0.204 &#xb1; 0.061 mm, teeth). The MS-D network took approximately 25 s to segment 1 CBCT scan, whereas manual segmentation took about 5 h. This study showed that multiclass segmentation of jaw and teeth was accurate and its performance was comparable to binary segmentation. The MS-D network trained for multiclass segmentation would therefore make patient-specific orthodontic treatment more feasible by strongly reducing the time required to segment multiple anatomic structures in CBCT scans.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33783247/

Machine learning (ML) is one subfield of AI, where computers learn rules from data, capturing its intrinsic statistical patterns and structures. Neural networks (NNs) have been increasingly employed for ML complex data. The application of multilayered NN is referred to as ""deep learning"", which has been recently investigated in dentistry. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are mainly used for processing large and complex imagery data, as they are able to extract image features like edges, corners, shapes, and macroscopic patterns using layers of filters. CNN algorithms allow to perform tasks like image classification, object detection and segmentation. The literature involving AI in dentistry has increased rapidly, so a methodological guidance for designing, conducting and reporting studies must be rigorously followed, including the improvement of datasets. The limited interaction between the dental field and the technical disciplines, however, remains a hurdle for applicable dental AI.

The present article aims to review existing dental literature that has examined deep learning, a subset of machine learning that has demonstrated the highest performance when applied to image processing and that has been tested as a formidable diagnostic support tool through its automated analysis of radiographic/photographic images. Furthermore, the article will critically evaluate the literature to describe potential methodological weaknesses of the studies and the need for further development. This review includes 28 studies that have described the applications of deep learning in various fields of dentistry. Research into the applications of deep learning in dentistry contains claims of its high accuracy. Nonetheless, many of these studies have substantial limitations and methodological issues (e.g., examiner reliability, the number of images used for training/testing, the methods used for validation) that have significantly limited the external validity of their results. Therefore, future studies that acknowledge the methodological limitations of existing literature will help to establish a better understanding of the usefulness of applying deep learning in dentistry.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33303419/

Moreover, AI, through machine or deep learning, permits the ability to develop predictive models from large datasets. Possibilities of predictive model development in machine learning are numerous dependent on the clinical question. For example, binary classifiers aim to stratify allocation to a categorical outcome, such as the presence or absence of a gastrointestinal disease. In addition, continuous variable fitting techniques can be used to predict quantity of a therapeutic response, thus offering a tool to predict which therapeutic intervention may be most beneficial to the given patient. Namely, this permits an important opportunity for personalization of medicine, including a movement from guideline-specific treatment algorithms to patient-specific ones, providing both clinician and patient the capacity for data-driven decision making. Furthermore, such analyses could predict the development of GI disease prior to the manifestation of symptoms, raising the possibility of prevention or pre-treatment.

Two authors independently screened the articles based on eligibility criteria and then, appraised the included articles. The findings are summarized in tabulation form and discussed using the narrative method. A total of 1249 entries were identified out of which 7 were finally included. The most often employed AI algorithms were the multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), and neural networks. The algorithms were built to perform the segmentation, classification, caries detection, diagnosis, and caries prediction from several sources, including periapical radiographs, panoramic radiographs, smartphone images, bitewing radiographs, near-infrared light transillumination images, and so forth. Convoluted neural networks (CNN) demonstrated high sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve in the caries detection, segmentation, and classification tests. Notably, AI in conjunction with periapical and panoramic radiography images yielded better accuracy in detecting and diagnosing dental caries.

Manual teeth segmentation, the gold standard up until now, is time-consuming, tedious, and observer-dependent. This study aims to develop an automated teeth segmentation and labeling system using deep learning. As a reference, 1750 OS were manually segmented and labeled. A deep-learning approach based on PointCNN and 3D U-net in combination with a rule-based heuristic algorithm and a combinatorial search algorithm was trained and validated on 1400 OS. Subsequently, the trained algorithm was applied to a test set consisting of 350 OS. The intersection over union (IoU), as a measure of accuracy, was calculated to quantify the degree of similarity between the annotated ground truth and the model predictions. The model achieved accurate teeth segmentations with a mean IoU score of 0.915. The FDI labels of the teeth were predicted with a mean accuracy of 0.894. The optical inspection showed excellent position agreements between the automatically and manually segmented teeth components. Minor flaws were mostly seen at the edges. The proposed method forms a promising foundation for time-effective and observer-independent teeth segmentation and labeling on intra-oral scans.

AI is a reliable platform to make dental care better, smoother, and time-saving for professionals. AI helps the dentistry professionals to fulfil demands of patients and to ensure quality treatment and better oral health care. AI can also help in predicting failures of clinical cases and gives reliable solutions. In this way, it helps in reducing morbidity ratio and increasing quality treatment of dental problem in population. The main objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of studies concerning the association between dental caries and machine learning. The objective of this study is to design according to the PICO criteria. A systematic search for randomized trials was conducted under the guidelines of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). In this study, e-search was conducted from four databases including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, and it involved studies from year 2008 to 2022. This study fetched a total of 133 articles, from which twelve are selected for this systematic review. We analyzed different types of machine learning algorithms from which deep learning is widely used with dental caries images dataset. Neural Network Backpropagation algorithm, one of the deep learning algorithms, gives a maximum accuracy of 99%. In this systematic review, we concluded how deep learning has been applied to the images of teeth to diagnose the detection of dental caries with its three types (proximal, occlusal, and root caries). Considering our findings, further well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate the diagnosis of further types of dental caries that are based on progression (chronic, acute, and arrested), which tells us about the severity of caries, virginity of lesion, and extent of caries. Apart from dental caries, AI in the future will emerge as supreme technology to detect other diseases of oral region combinedly and comprehensively because AI will easily analyze big datasets that contain multiple records.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35399834/

38448657,Deep learning methods for fully automated dental age estimation on orthopantomograms.,"Shi Y, Ye Z, Guo J, Tang Y, Dong W, Dai J, Miao Y, You M",Clinical oral investigations,2024 Mar 7,10.1007/s00784-024-05598-2,"This study aimed to use all permanent teeth as the target and establish an automated dental age estimation method across all developmental stages of permanent teeth, accomplishing all the essential steps of tooth determination, tooth development staging, and dental age assessment. A three-step framework for automatically estimating dental age was developed for children aged 3 to 15. First, a YOLOv3 network was employed to complete the tasks of tooth localization and numbering on a digital orthopantomogram. Second, a novel network named SOS-Net was established for accurate tooth development staging based on a modified Demirjian method. Finally, the dental age assessment procedure was carried out through a single-group meta-analysis utilizing the statistical data derived from our reference dataset. The performance tests showed that the one-stage YOLOv3 detection network attained an overall mean average precision 50 of 97.50 for tooth determination. The proposed SOS-Net method achieved an average tooth development staging accuracy of 82.97% for a full dentition. The dental age assessment validation test yielded an MAE of 0.72&#xa0;years with a full dentition (excluding the third molars) as its input. The proposed automated framework enhances the dental age estimation process in a fast and standard manner, enabling the reference of any accessible population. The tooth development staging network can facilitate the precise identification of permanent teeth with abnormal growth, improving the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of dental diagnoses using pediatric orthopantomograms.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38448657/

37517787,Deep learning-based segmentation of dental implants on cone-beam computed tomography images: A validation study.,"Elgarba BM, Van Aelst S, Swaity A, Morgan N, Shujaat S, Jacobs R",Journal of dentistry,2023 Oct,10.1016/j.jdent.2023.104639,"To train and validate a cloud-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model for automated segmentation (AS) of dental implant and attached prosthetic crown on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. A total dataset of 280 maxillomandibular jawbone CBCT scans was acquired from patients who underwent implant placement with or without coronal restoration. The dataset was randomly divided into three subsets: training set (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;225), validation set (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;25) and testing set (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30). A CNN model was developed and trained using expert-based semi-automated segmentation (SS) of the implant and attached prosthetic crown as the ground truth. The performance of AS was assessed by comparing with SS and manually corrected automated segmentation referred to as refined-automated segmentation (R-AS). Evaluation metrics included timing, voxel-wise comparison based on confusion matrix and 3D surface differences. The average time required for AS was 60 times faster (&lt;30&#xa0;s) than the SS approach. The CNN model was highly effective in segmenting dental implants both with and without coronal restoration, achieving a high dice similarity coefficient score of 0.92&#xb1;0.02 and 0.91&#xb1;0.03, respectively. Moreover, the root mean square deviation values were also found to be low (implant only: 0.08&#xb1;0.09&#xa0;mm, implant+restoration: 0.11&#xb1;0.07&#xa0;mm) when compared with R-AS, implying high AI segmentation accuracy. The proposed cloud-based deep learning tool demonstrated high performance and time-efficient segmentation of implants on CBCT images. AI-based segmentation of implants and prosthetic crowns can minimize the negative impact of artifacts and enhance the generalizability of creating dental virtual models. Furthermore, incorporating the suggested tool into existing CNN models specialized for segmenting anatomical structures can improve pre-surgical planning for implants and post-operative assessment of peri&#x2011;implant bone levels.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37517787/

Segmentation of 3D renderings of biomineralized structures has long been a bottleneck because of human limitations such as our available time, attention span, eye-hand coordination, cognitive biases, and attainable precision, amongst other limitations. Since recently, some of these routine limitations appear to be surmountable thanks to the development of deep-learning algorithms for biological imagery in general, and for 3D image segmentation in particular. Many components of deep learning often appear too abstract for a life scientist. Despite this, the basic principles underlying deep learning have many easy-to-grasp commonalities with human learning and universal logic. This primer presents these basic principles in what we feel is an intuitive manner, without relying on prerequisite knowledge of informatics and computer science, and with the aim of improving the reader's general literacy in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Here, biomineralization case studies are presented to illustrate the application of deep learning for solving segmentation and analysis problems of 3D images ridden by various artifacts, and/or which are plainly difficult to interpret. The presented portfolio of case studies includes three examples of imaging using micro-computed tomography (&#xb5;CT), and three examples using focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), all on mineralized tissues. We believe this primer will expand the circle of users of deep learning amongst biomineralization researchers and other life scientists involved with 3D imaging, and will encourage incorporation of this powerful tool into their professional skillsets and to explore it further.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32783967/

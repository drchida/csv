"The term ""artificial intelligence"" (AI) refers to the idea of machines being capable of performing human tasks. A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which ""learns"" intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (""explainable AI""). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce.",Schwendicke F; Samek W; Krois J,10.1177/0022034520915714 [doi],7,Journal of dental research,United States,1544-0591 (Electronic) 0022-0345 (Print) 0022-0345 (Linking),"*Artificial Intelligence; Dentistry; Forecasting; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted",32315260,769-774,2020 Jul,Journal Article; Review,Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry: Chances and Challenges.,99

"OBJECTIVES: Detecting caries lesions is challenging for dentists, and deep learning models may help practitioners to increase accuracy and reliability. We aimed to systematically review deep learning studies on caries detection. DATA: We selected diagnostic accuracy studies that used deep learning models on dental imagery (including radiographs, photographs, optical coherence tomography images, near-infrared light transillumination images). The latest version of the quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used for risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in the studies methods and their performance measurements. SOURCES: Databases (Medline via PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase) and a repository (ArXiv) were screened for publications published after 2010, without any limitation on language. STUDY SELECTION: From 252 potentially eligible references, 48 studies were assessed full-text and 42 included, using classification (n = 26), object detection (n = 6), or segmentation models (n = 10). A wide range of performance metrics was used; image, object or pixel accuracy ranged between 68%-99%. The minority of studies (n = 11) showed a low risk of biases in all domains, and 13 studies (31.0%) low risk for concerns regarding applicability. The accuracy of caries classification models varied, i.e. 71% to 96% on intra-oral photographs, 82% to 99.2% on peri-apical radiographs, 87.6% to 95.4% on bitewing radiographs, 68.0% to 78.0% on near-infrared transillumination images, 88.7% to 95.2% on optical coherence tomography images, and 86.1% to 96.1% on panoramic radiographs. Pooled diagnostic odds ratios varied from 2.27 to 32,767. For detection and segmentation models, heterogeneity in reporting did not allow useful pooling. CONCLUSION: An increasing number of studies investigated caries detection using deep learning, with a diverse types of architectures being employed. Reported accuracy seems promising, while study and reporting quality are currently low.

"In the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) research has been rapidly developing and emerging in the field of dental and maxillofacial radiology. Dental radiography, which is commonly used in daily practices, provides an incredibly rich resource for AI development and attracted many researchers to develop its application for various purposes. This study reviewed the applicability of AI for dental radiography from the current studies. Online searches on PubMed and IEEE Xplore databases, up to December 2020, and subsequent manual searches were performed. Then, we categorized the application of AI according to similarity of the following purposes: diagnosis of dental caries, periapical pathologies, and periodontal bone loss; cyst and tumor classification; cephalometric analysis; screening of osteoporosis; tooth recognition and forensic odontology; dental implant system recognition; and image quality enhancement. Current development of AI methodology in each aforementioned application were subsequently discussed. Although most of the reviewed studies demonstrated a great potential of AI application for dental radiography, further development is still needed before implementation in clinical routine due to several challenges and limitations, such as lack of datasets size justification and unstandardized reporting format. Considering the current limitations and challenges, future AI research in dental radiography should follow standardized reporting formats in order to align the research designs and enhance the impact of AI development globally.",Putra RH; Doi C; Yoda N; Astuti ER; Sasaki K,10.1259/dmfr.20210197 [doi] 20210197,1,Dento maxillo facial radiology,England,0250-832X (Print) 1476-542X (Electronic) 0250-832X (Linking),"Artificial Intelligence; *Dental Caries; Humans; Radiography; Radiography, Dental, Digital; *Radiology",34233515,20210197,2022 Jan 1,Journal Article,Current applications and development of artificial intelligence for digital dental radiography.,51
"This literature research had two main objectives. The first objective was to quantify how frequently artificial intelligence (AI) was utilized in dental literature from 2011 until 2021. The second objective was to distinguish the focus of such publications; in particular, dental field and topic. The main inclusion criterium was an original article or review in English focused on dental utilization of AI. All other types of publications or non-dental or non-AI-focused were excluded. The information sources were Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, queried on 19 April 2022. The search string was ""artificial intelligence"" AND (dental OR dentistry OR tooth OR teeth OR dentofacial OR maxillofacial OR orofacial OR orthodontics OR endodontics OR periodontics OR prosthodontics). Following the removal of duplicates, all remaining publications were returned by searches and were screened by three independent operators to minimize the risk of bias. The analysis of 2011-2021 publications identified 4413 records, from which 1497 were finally selected and calculated according to the year of publication. The results confirmed a historically unprecedented boom in AI dental publications, with an average increase of 21.6% per year over the last decade and a 34.9% increase per year over the last 5 years. In the achievement of the second objective, qualitative assessment of dental AI publications since 2021 identified 1717 records, with 497 papers finally selected. The results of this assessment indicated the relative proportions of focal topics, as follows: radiology 26.36%, orthodontics 18.31%, general scope 17.10%, restorative 12.09%, surgery 11.87% and education 5.63%.

"Deep learning (DL) has been employed for a wide range of tasks in dentistry. We aimed to systematically review studies employing DL for periodontal and implantological purposes. A systematic electronic search was conducted on four databases (Medline via PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase) and a repository (ArXiv) for publications after 2010, without any limitation on language. In the present review, we included studies that reported deep learning models' performance on periodontal or oral implantological tasks. Given the heterogeneities in the included studies, no meta-analysis was performed. The risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. We included 47 studies: focusing on imaging data (n = 20) and non-imaging data in periodontology (n = 12), or dental implantology (n = 15). The detection of periodontitis and gingivitis or periodontal bone loss, the classification of dental implant systems, or the prediction of treatment outcomes in periodontology and implantology were major use cases.

"Dentistry increasingly integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve the current state of clinical dental practice. However, this revolutionary technological field raises various complex ethical challenges. The objective of this systematic scoping review is to document the current uses of AI in dentistry and the ethical concerns or challenges they imply. Three health care databases (MEDLINE [PubMed], SciVerse Scopus, and Cochrane Library) and 2 computer science databases (ArXiv, IEEE Xplore) were searched. After identifying 1,553 records, the documents were filtered, and a full-text screening was performed. In total, 178 studies were retained and analyzed by 8 researchers specialized in dentistry, AI, and ethics. The team used Covidence for data extraction and Dedoose for the identification of ethics-related information. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Among the included studies, 130 (73.0%) studies were published after 2016, and 93 (52.2%) were published in journals specialized in computer sciences. The technologies used were neural learning techniques for 75 (42.1%), traditional learning techniques for 76 (42.7%), or a combination of several technologies for 20 (11.2%). Overall, 7 countries contributed to 109 (61.2%) studies. A total of 53 different applications of AI in dentistry were identified, involving most dental specialties. The use of initial data sets for internal validation was reported in 152 (85.4%) studies. Forty-five ethical issues (related to the use AI in dentistry) were reported in 22 (12.4%) studies around 6 principles: prudence (10 times), equity (8), privacy (8), responsibility (6), democratic participation (4), and solidarity (4). The ratio of studies mentioning AI-related ethical issues has remained similar in the past years, showing that there is no increasing interest in the field of dentistry on this topic. This study confirms the growing presence of AI in dentistry and highlights a current lack of information on the ethical challenges surrounding its use. In addition, the scarcity of studies sharing their code could prevent future replications. The authors formulate recommendations to contribute to a more responsible use of AI technologies in dentistry.",Morch CM; Atsu S; Cai W; Li X; Madathil SA; Liu X; Mai V; Tamimi F; Dilhac MA; Ducret M,10.1177/00220345211013808 [doi],13,Journal of dental research,United States,1544-0591 (Electronic) 0022-0345 (Linking),*Artificial Intelligence; *Delivery of Health Care; Dentistry; Forecasting,34060359,1452-1460,2021 Dec,Journal Article; Scoping Review,Artificial Intelligence and Ethics in Dentistry: A Scoping Review.,100
"Background: Machine learning (ML) is a key component of artificial intelligence (AI). The terms machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning are erroneously used interchangeably as they appear as monolithic nebulous entities. This technology offers immense possibilities and opportunities to advance diagnostics in the field of medicine and dentistry. This necessitates a deep understanding of AI and its essential components, such as machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANN), and deep learning (DP). Aim: This review aims to enlighten clinicians regarding AI and its applications in the diagnosis of oral diseases, along with the prospects and challenges involved. Review results: AI has been used in the diagnosis of various oral diseases, such as dental caries, maxillary sinus diseases, periodontal diseases, salivary gland diseases, TMJ disorders, and oral cancer through clinical data and diagnostic images. Larger data sets would enable AI to predict the occurrence of precancerous conditions. They can aid in population-wide surveillance and decide on referrals to specialists. AI can efficiently detect microfeatures beyond the human eye and augment its predictive power in critical diagnosis. Conclusion: Although studies have recognized the benefit of AI, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has not been integrated into routine dentistry. AI is still in the research phase. The coming decade will see immense changes in diagnosis and healthcare built on the back of this research. Clinical significance: This paper reviews the various applications of AI in dentistry and illuminates the shortcomings faced while dealing with AI research and suggests ways to tackle them. Overcoming these pitfalls will aid in integrating AI seamlessly into dentistry.",Patil S; Albogami S; Hosmani J; Mujoo S; Kamil MA; Mansour MA; Abdul HN; Bhandi S; Ahmed SSSJ,10.3390/diagnostics12051029 [doi] 1029,5,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",Switzerland,2075-4418 (Print) 2075-4418 (Electronic) 2075-4418 (Linking),N/A,35626185,N/A,2022 Apr 19,Journal Article; Review,Artificial Intelligence in the Diagnosis of Oral Diseases: Applications and Pitfalls.,12

"AIM: This comprehensive review is aimed at evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of artificial intelligence in endodontic dentistry. INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a relatively new technology that has widespread use in dentistry. The AI technologies have primarily been used in dentistry to diagnose dental diseases, plan treatment, make clinical decisions, and predict the prognosis. AI models like convolutional neural networks (CNN) and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been used in endodontics to study root canal system anatomy, determine working length measurements, detect periapical lesions and root fractures, predict the success of retreatment procedures, and predict the viability of dental pulp stem cells. Methodology. The literature was searched in electronic databases such as Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, published over the last four decades (January 1980 to September 15, 2021) by using keywords such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, application, endodontics, and dentistry. RESULTS: The preliminary search yielded 2560 articles relevant enough to the paper's purpose. A total of 88 articles met the eligibility criteria. The majority of research on AI application in endodontics has concentrated on tracing apical foramen, verifying the working length, projection of periapical pathologies, root morphologies, and retreatment predictions and discovering the vertical root fractures. CONCLUSION: In endodontics, AI displayed accuracy in terms of diagnostic and prognostic evaluations. The use of AI can help enhance the treatment plan, which in turn can lead to an increase in the success rate of endodontic treatment outcomes. The AI is used extensively in endodontics and could help in clinical applications, such as detecting root fractures, periapical pathologies, determining working length, tracing apical foramen, the morphology of root, and disease prediction.",Karobari MI; Adil AH; Basheer SN; Murugesan S; Savadamoorthi KS; Mustafa M; Abdulwahed A; Almokhatieb AA,10.1155/2023/7049360 [doi] 7049360,N/A,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,United States,1748-6718 (Electronic) 1748-670X (Print) 1748-670X (Linking),"Humans; *Artificial Intelligence; *Fractures, Bone; Prognosis; Root Canal Therapy/methods; Treatment Outcome; *Endodontics",36761829,7049360,2023,Journal Article; Review,Evaluation of the Diagnostic and Prognostic Accuracy of Artificial Intelligence in Endodontic Dentistry: A Comprehensive Review of Literature.,2023
"OBJECTIVES: Periapical periodontitis and caries are common chronic oral diseases affecting most teenagers and adults worldwide. The purpose of this study was to develop an evaluation tool to automatically detect dental caries and periapical periodontitis on periapical radiographs using deep learning. METHODS: A modified deep learning model was developed using a large dataset (4129 images) with high-quality annotations to support the automatic detection of both dental caries and periapical periodontitis. The performance of the model was compared to the classification performance of dentists. RESULTS: The deep learning model automatically distinguished dental caries with an F1-score of 0.829 and periapical periodontitis with an F1-score of 0.828. The comparison of model-only and expert-only detection performance showed that the accuracy of the fully automatic method was significantly higher than that of the young dentists. With deep learning assistance, the experts not only reached a higher diagnostic accuracy with an average F1-score of 0.7844 for dental caries and 0.8208 for periapical periodontitis compared to expert-only scenarios, but also increased inter-observer agreement from 0.585/0.590 to 0.726/0.713 for dental caries and from 0.623/0.563 to 0.752/0.740 for periapical periodontitis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these experimental results, deep learning can improve the accuracy and consistency of evaluating dental caries and periapical periodontitis on periapical radiographs.

"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the success of the artificial intelligence (AI) system in implant planning using three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. METHODS: Seventy-five CBCT images were included in this study. In these images, bone height and thickness in 508 regions where implants were required were measured by a human observer with manual assessment method using InvivoDental 6.0 (Anatomage Inc. San Jose, CA, USA). Also, canals/sinuses/fossae associated with alveolar bones and missing tooth regions were detected. Following, all evaluations were repeated using the deep convolutional neural network (Diagnocat, Inc., San Francisco, USA) The jaws were separated as mandible/maxilla and each jaw was grouped as anterior/premolar/molar teeth region. The data obtained from manual assessment and AI methods were compared using Bland-Altman analysis and Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: In the bone height measurements, there were no statistically significant differences between AI and manual measurements in the premolar region of mandible and the premolar and molar regions of the maxilla (p > 0.05). In the bone thickness measurements, there were statistically significant differences between AI and manual measurements in all regions of maxilla and mandible (p < 0.001). Also, the percentage of right detection was 72.2% for canals, 66.4% for sinuses/fossae and 95.3% for missing tooth regions.

"OBJECTIVES: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a rapidly emerging new area of medical research, and have yielded impressive results in diagnosis and prediction in the fields of radiology and pathology. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of deep CNN algorithms for detection and diagnosis of dental caries on periapical radiographs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 3000 periapical radiographic images were divided into a training and validation dataset (n = 2400 [80%]) and a test dataset (n = 600 [20%]). A pre-trained GoogLeNet Inception v3 CNN network was used for preprocessing and transfer learning. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for detection and diagnostic performance of the deep CNN algorithm. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracies of premolar, molar, and both premolar and molar models were 89.0% (80.4-93.3), 88.0% (79.2-93.1), and 82.0% (75.5-87.1), respectively. The deep CNN algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.917 (95% CI 0.860-0.975) on premolar, an AUC of 0.890 (95% CI 0.819-0.961) on molar, and an AUC of 0.845 (95% CI 0.790-0.901) on both premolar and molar models. The premolar model provided the best AUC, which was significantly greater than those for other models (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the potential utility of deep CNN architecture for the detection and diagnosis of dental caries.

"Apical periodontitis (AP) is one of the most prevalent disorders in dentistry. However, it can be underdiagnosed in asymptomatic patients. In addition, the perioperative evaluation of 3-dimensional (3D) lesion volume is of great clinical relevance, but the required slice-by-slice manual delineation method is time- and labor-intensive. Here, for quickly and accurately detecting and segmenting periapical lesions (PALs) associated with AP on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images, we proposed and geographically validated a novel 3D deep convolutional neural network algorithm, named PAL-Net. On the internal 5-fold cross-validation set, our PAL-Net achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.98. The algorithm also improved the diagnostic performance of dentists with varying levels of experience, as evidenced by their enhanced average AUC values (junior dentists: 0.89-0.94; senior dentists: 0.91-0.93), and significantly reduced the diagnostic time (junior dentists: 69.3 min faster; senior dentists: 32.4 min faster). Moreover, our PAL-Net achieved an average Dice similarity coefficient over 0.87 (0.85-0.88), which is superior or comparable to that of other existing state-of-the-art PAL segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we validated the generalizability of the PAL-Net system using multiple external data sets from Central, East, and North China, showing that our PAL-Net has strong robustness. Our PAL-Net can help improve the diagnostic performance and speed of dentists working from CBCT images, provide clinically relevant volume information to dentists, and can potentially be applied in dental clinics, especially without expert-level dentists or radiologists.",Fu WT; Zhu QK; Li N; Wang YQ; Deng SL; Chen HP; Shen J; Meng LY; Bian Z,10.1177/00220345231201793 [doi],1,Journal of dental research,United States,1544-0591 (Electronic) 0022-0345 (Linking),"Humans; *Spiral Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Algorithms; Neural Networks, Computer; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; *Periapical Periodontitis/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods",37968798,12-May,2024 Jan,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Clinically Oriented CBCT Periapical Lesion Evaluation via 3D CNN Algorithm.,103

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and dentistry. Recently, there has been much interest in the development of AI applications. Dentomaxillofacial radiology (DMFR) is within the scope of these applications due to its compatibility with image processing methods. Classification and segmentation of teeth, automatic marking of anatomical structures and cephalometric analysis, determination of early dental diseases, gingival, periodontal diseases and evaluation of risk groups, diagnosis of certain diseases, such as; osteoporosis that can be detected in jaw radiographs are among studies conducted by using radiological images. Further research in the field of AI will make great contributions to DMFR. We aim to discuss most recent AI-based studies in the field of DMFR.",Gokdeniz ST; Kamburoglu K,10.4329/wjr.v14.i3.55 [doi],3,World journal of radiology,United States,1949-8470 (Print) 1949-8470 (Electronic) 1949-8470 (Linking),N/A,35432776,55-59,2022 Mar 28,Editorial,Artificial intelligence in dentomaxillofacial radiology.,14
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has grown tremendously in the past decade. The application of AI in teledentistry can reform the way dental care, dental education, research, and subsequent innovations can happen remotely. Machine learning including deep learning-based algorithms can be developed to create predictive models of risk assessment for oral health related conditions, consequent complications, and patient stratification. Patients can be empowered to self-diagnose and apply preventive measures or self-manage some early stages of dental diseases. Applications of AI in teledentistry can be beneficial for both, the dental surgeon and the patient. AI enables better remote screening, diagnosis, record keeping, triaging, and monitoring of dental patients based on smart devices. This will take away rudimentary cases requiring run-of-the-mill treatments from dentists and enable them to concentrate on highly complex cases. This would also enable the dentists to serve a larger and deprived population in inaccessible areas. Its usage in teledentistry can bring a paradigm shift from curative to preventive personalised approach in dentistry. A strong asset to teledentistry could be a robust and comprehensive feedback mechanism routed through various channels proposed in this paper. This paper discusses the application of AI in teledentistry and proposes a feedback mechanism to enhance performance in teledentistry.",Batra P; Tagra H; Katyal S,10.15190/d.2022.12 [doi] 153,3,"Discoveries (Craiova, Romania)",Romania,2359-7232 (Electronic) 2359-7232 (Linking),N/A,36530958,153,2022 Jul-Sep,Journal Article; Review,Artificial Intelligence in Teledentistry.,10

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. AI is not a new term, the concept of AI can be dated back to 1950. However, it did not become a practical tool until two decades ago. Owing to the rapid development of three cornerstones of current AI technology-big data (coming through digital devices), computational power, and AI algorithm-in the past two decades, AI applications have started to provide convenience to people's lives. In dentistry, AI has been adopted in all dental disciplines, i.e., operative dentistry, periodontics, orthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and prosthodontics. The majority of the AI applications in dentistry are for diagnosis based on radiographic or optical images, while other tasks are not as applicable as image-based tasks mainly due to the constraints of data availability, data uniformity, and computational power for handling 3D data. Evidence-based dentistry (EBD) is regarded as the gold standard for decision making by dental professionals, while AI machine learning (ML) models learn from human expertise. ML can be seen as another valuable tool to assist dental professionals in multiple stages of clinical cases. This review describes the history and classification of AI, summarizes AI applications in dentistry, discusses the relationship between EBD and ML, and aims to help dental professionals better understand AI as a tool to support their routine work with improved efficiency.",Ding H; Wu J; Zhao W; Matinlinna JP; Burrow MF; Tsoi JKH,10.3389/fdmed.2023.1085251 [doi] 1085251,N/A,Frontiers in dental medicine,Switzerland,2673-4915 (Electronic) 2673-4915 (Linking),N/A,39935549,1085251,2023,Journal Article; Review,Artificial intelligence in dentistry-A review.,4

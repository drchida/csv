It can be helpful in many fields where the human may be assisted and helped by new technologies. Neural networks are a part of artificial intelligence, and are similar to the human brain in their work and can solve given problems and make fast decisions. This review shows that artificial intelligence and the use of neural networks has developed very rapidly in recent years, and it may be an ordinary tool in modern dentistry in the near future. The advantages of this process are better efficiency, accuracy, and time saving during the diagnosis and treatment planning. More research and improvements are needed in the use of neural networks in dentistry to put them into daily practice and to facilitate the work of the dentist.",10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_440_19,artificial intelligence; dentistry; neural networks
32315260,Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry: Chances and Challenges.,"Schwendicke, F; Samek, W; Krois, J",Journal of dental research,Jul 2020,"The term ""artificial intelligence"" (AI) refers to the idea of machines being capable of performing human tasks. A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which ""learns"" intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (""explainable AI""). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce.",10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2944481,decision-making; deep learning; dental; diagnostic systems; informatics; machine learning

However, orthodontic treatment planning and evaluation remains a specialist's task and responsibility. As the prediction of growth in orthodontic patients and response to orthodontic treatment is inherently complex and individual, orthodontists make use of features gathered from longitudinal, multimodal, and standardized orthodontic data sets. Currently, these data sets are used by the orthodontist to make informed, rule-based treatment decisions. In research, artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied to assist orthodontists with the extraction of relevant data from such data sets. Here, AI has been applied for the analysis of clinical imagery, such as automated landmark detection in lateral cephalograms but also for evaluation of intraoral scans or photographic data. Furthermore, AI is applied to help orthodontists with decision support for treatment decisions such as the need for orthognathic surgery or for orthodontic tooth extractions. One major challenge in current AI research in orthodontics is the limited generalizability, as most studies use unicentric data with high risks of bias. Moreover, comparing AI across different studies and tasks is virtually impossible as both outcomes and outcome metrics vary widely, and underlying data sets are not standardized.

Dentists should have an understanding of the foundational concepts and the ability to critically evaluate dental research in AI. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that most dental AI research is dedicated to. The most prolific area of ML research is automated interpretation of dental imaging. Other areas include providing treatment recommendations, predicting future disease and treatment outcomes. The research impact is limited by small datasets that do not harness the positive correlation between very large datasets and ML performance. There is also a need to standardize research methodologies and utilize performance metrics that are appropriate for the clinical context. In addition to research challenges, this article discusses the ethical, legal and logistical considerations associated with implementation in clinical practice. This includes explainable AI, model bias, data privacy and security. The future implications of AI in dentistry involve a promise for a novel form of practicing dentistry however, the effect of AI on patient outcomes is yet to be determined.",10.1111/adj.12812,artificial intelligence; dentistry; imaging; machine learning; neural networks

This work aimed to investigate the technical feasibility of creating a decision-making tool based on I3M to support expert decision-making. Methods: The dataset consisted of 456 images from France and Uganda. Two deep learning approaches (Mask R-CNN, U-Net) were compared on mandibular radiographs, leading to a two-part instance segmentation (apical and coronal). Then, two topological data analysis approaches were compared on the inferred mask: one with a deep learning component (TDA-DL), one without (TDA). Regarding mask inference, U-Net had a better accuracy (mean intersection over union metric (mIoU)), 91.2% compared to 83.8% for Mask R-CNN. The combination of U-Net with TDA or TDA-DL to compute the I3M score revealed satisfying results in comparison with a dental forensic expert. The mean ± SD absolute error was 0.04 ± 0.03 for TDA, and 0.06 ± 0.04 for TDA-DL. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the I3M scores between the expert and a U-Net model was 0.93 when combined with TDA and 0.89 with TDA-DL. This pilot study illustrates the potential feasibility to automate an I3M solution combining a deep learning and a topological approach, with 95% accuracy in comparison with an expert.",10.1016/j.jds.2022.12.003,age estimation; artificial intelligence; deep learning; dentistry; machine learning; neural network; topological analysis

The LLMs were queried with 20 open-type, clinical dentistry-related questions from different disciplines, developed by the respective faculty of the School of Dentistry, European University Cyprus. The LLMs' answers were graded 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) points against strong, traditionally collected scientific evidence, such as guidelines and consensus statements, using a rubric, as if they were examination questions posed to students, by 2 experienced faculty members. The scores were statistically compared to identify the best-performing model using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. Moreover, the evaluators were asked to provide a qualitative evaluation of the comprehensiveness, scientific accuracy, clarity, and relevance of the LLMs' answers. Overall, no statistically significant difference was detected between the scores given by the 2 evaluators; therefore, an average score was computed for every LLM.

34259428,"Role of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in Oral Health and Preventive Dentistry - Knowledge, Perception and Attitude of Dentists.","Abouzeid, Hoda Lotfy; Chaturvedi, Saurabh; Abdelaziz, Khalid M; Alzahrani, Fawziah Ahmed; AlQarni, Abdulhkeem Ali Salim; Alqahtani, Nasser M",Oral health & preventive dentistry,15 Jul 2021,"To assess the knowledge, attitude and perception of dentists (dental students, dental school graduates/interns, postgraduate dentists) of the role of robotics (R) and artificial intelligence (AI) in oral health and preventive dentistry. The null hypothesis was that dentists would not be aware of R and AI use in dentistry and would not be ready to accept them in oral health and preventive dentistry for dental care management and training. This was an observational cross-sectional study in which data was collected from a representative population in Saudi Arabia. 570 participants answered 26 closed-ended questions. The questionnaire's validity and reliability were evaluated for vetting and remarks. The questionnaire collected demographic data of participants and their knowledge, perception and attitude about R and AI. Questions were to be answered with 'yes', 'no' and 'I don't know'. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed using the control chart technique and the chi-squared test, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. The majority of the participants (n = 313; 54.6%) were males. Dental students, dentist school graduates/interns, and postgraduate dentists comprised of 58.8%, 18.2%, and 23.0% respectively. Most of the respondents gave affirmative answers for knowledge, attitude and perception of R and AI (58.3%, 67.4%, and 60.3%, respectively). Participants agreed that R and AI is beneficial in dentistry and would provide better results. Most (83.3%) would be willing to be treated using R/AI and would recommend (84.5%) treatment with R/AI, as shown in the control chart by affirmative answers. These were significantly above the overall affirmative answers, as the corresponding point lies above 95% UCL (upper confidence limit). Most dentists were unacquainted with R and AI. Dentists had a positive attitude towards R/AI, but due to inadequate knowledge and understanding, its use and applications were very limited. There is significant need in the near future to increase awareness of this concept, as it may increase treatment efficiency and effectiveness.",10.3290/j.ohpd.b1693873,artificial intelligence; digital dentistry; oral health; questionnaire; robotics; survey
33783247,Multiclass CBCT Image Segmentation for Orthodontics with Deep Learning.,"Wang, H; Minnema, J; Batenburg, K J; Forouzanfar, T; Hu, F J; Wu, G",Journal of dental research,Aug 2021,"Accurate segmentation of the jaw (i.e., mandible and maxilla) and the teeth in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is essential for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Although various (semi)automated methods have been proposed to segment the jaw or the teeth, there is still a lack of fully automated segmentation methods that can simultaneously segment both anatomic structures in CBCT scans (i.e., multiclass segmentation). In this study, we aimed to train and validate a mixed-scale dense (MS-D) convolutional neural network for multiclass segmentation of the jaw, the teeth, and the background in CBCT scans. Thirty CBCT scans were obtained from patients who had undergone orthodontic treatment. Gold standard segmentation labels were manually created by 4 dentists. As a benchmark, we also evaluated MS-D networks that segmented the jaw or the teeth (i.e., binary segmentation). All segmented CBCT scans were converted to virtual 3-dimensional (3D) models. The segmentation performance of all trained MS-D networks was assessed by the Dice similarity coefficient and surface deviation. The CBCT scans segmented by the MS-D network demonstrated a large overlap with the gold standard segmentations (Dice similarity coefficient: 0.934 ± 0.019, jaw; 0.945 ± 0.021, teeth). The MS-D network-based 3D models of the jaw and the teeth showed minor surface deviations when compared with the corresponding gold standard 3D models (0.390 ± 0.093 mm, jaw; 0.204 ± 0.061 mm, teeth). The MS-D network took approximately 25 s to segment 1 CBCT scan, whereas manual segmentation took about 5 h. This study showed that multiclass segmentation of jaw and teeth was accurate and its performance was comparable to binary segmentation. The MS-D network trained for multiclass segmentation would therefore make patient-specific orthodontic treatment more feasible by strongly reducing the time required to segment multiple anatomic structures in CBCT scans.",10.21203/rs.3.rs-56882/v3,artificial intelligence; dentofacial deformities; diagnostic imaging; facial bones; image processing; neural networks

This study analyzed the performance of LLMAs on solving restorative dentistry and endodontics (RDE) student assessment questions. 151 questions from a RDE question pool were prepared for prompting using LLMAs from OpenAI (ChatGPT-3.5,-4.0 and -4.0o) and Google (Gemini 1.0). Multiple-choice questions were sorted into four question subcategories, entered into LLMAs and answers recorded for analysis. P-value and chi-square statistical analyses were performed using Python 3.9.16. The total answer accuracy of ChatGPT-4.0o was the highest, followed by ChatGPT-4.0, Gemini 1.0 and ChatGPT-3.5 (72%, 62%, 44% and 25%, respectively) with significant differences between all LLMAs except GPT-4.0 models. The performance on subcategories direct restorations and caries was the highest, followed by indirect restorations and endodontics. Overall, there are large performance differences among LLMAs. Only the ChatGPT-4 models achieved a success ratio that could be used with caution to support the dental academic curriculum. While LLMAs could support clinicians to answer dental field-related questions, this capacity depends strongly on the employed model. The most performant model ChatGPT-4.0o achieved acceptable accuracy rates in some subject sub-categories analyzed.",10.1007/s00784-024-05968-w,Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Gemini; GenAI; Natural language processing

These applications have optimised dental workflows, demonstrating significant clinical importance. Understanding the current landscape and trends of this topic is crucial for both clinicians and researchers to utilise and advance this technology. However, a comprehensive scientometric study regarding this field had yet to be performed. A literature search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection database to identify eligible ""research articles"" and ""reviews."" Literature screening and exclusion were performed by 2 investigators. Thereafter, VOSviewer was utilised in co-occurrence analysis and CiteSpace in co-citation analysis. R package Bibliometrix was employed to automatically calculate scientific impacts, determining the core authors and journals. Altmetric data were described narratively and supplemented with Spearman correlation analysis. A total of 1558 research publications were included. During the past 5 years, AI-related dental publications drastically increased in number, from 36 to 581. Diagnostics and Scientific Reports published the most articles, whereas Journal of Dental Research received the highest number of citations per article. China, the US, and South Korea emerged as the most prolific countries, whilst Germany received the highest number of citations per article (23.29). Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin was the institution with the highest number of publications and citations per article (29.16). Altmetric Attention Score was correlated with News Mentions (P < .001), and significant associations were observed amongst Dimension Citations, Mendeley Readers, and Web of Science Citations (P < .001). The publication numbers regarding AI-related dental research have been rising rapidly and may continue their upwards trend. China, the US, South Korea, and Germany had promoted the progress of AI-related dental research. Disease diagnosis, orthodontic applications, and morphology segmentation were current hotspots.

While personalized dental medicine is still far from being a reality, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with improved data analytic approaches are expected to integrate diverse data from the individual, setting, and system levels, which may facilitate a deeper understanding of the interaction of these multilevel data and therefore bring us closer to more personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry, also known as P4 dentistry. In the field of dentomaxillofacial imaging, a wide range of AI applications, including several commercially available software options, have been proposed to assist dentists in the diagnosis and treatment planning of various dentomaxillofacial diseases, with performance similar or even superior to that of specialists. Notably, the impact of these dental AI applications on treatment decision, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, and cost-effectiveness has so far been assessed sparsely. Such information should be further investigated in future studies to provide patients, providers, and healthcare organizers a clearer picture of the true usefulness of AI in daily dental practice.",10.3390/jcm11082143,artificial intelligence; deep learning; dentistry; diagnostic imaging; personalized medicine
